# etch-a-sketch

This application allows users to etch a sketch. It was created with HTML/CSS and JS.

**How it works**
--

- User indicates a grid size for the etch-a-sketch area. A grid can be created up to 128 x 128 pixels.
- An eventListener on every grid-item changes the background-color to colored upon hover.
- Once the erase button is clicked, it changes the background-color to white.
- Clearing simply creates a new grid of the designated size.
- Upon pressing alt, the hover event returns instead of changing the background-color, allowing the user to discontinue his drawing to move his cursor to his desired spot.

**To improve**
--
- Improve UI with CSS.
- Add functionality to choose colors.
